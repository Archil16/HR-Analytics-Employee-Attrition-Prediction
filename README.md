## How I made this Dashboard
- Conducted multi-factor attrition analysis using employee data, identifying key trends across age, department, marital status, gender, and job satisfaction; revealed higher attrition among younger employees in Sales and R&D with low satisfaction scores.
- Correlated performance ratings with job roles and attrition patterns, uncovering that mid-performing employees in high-travel roles showed increased turnover, informing targeted retention strategies.
- Visualized HR metrics in Power BI, including age-wise departmental breakdowns and overtime impact on satisfaction, enabling data-driven decisions for workforce planning and employee engagement.
